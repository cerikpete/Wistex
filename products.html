                    <strong>7010 Series Float Switch</strong>: 
                    7010 Switch Float Assemblies- The B/W Controls Float Switches are tilt actuated liquid level controls, designed to operate pumps, valves, 
                    multiple alternators, relays, contactors, alarms and similar equipment for industrial and commercial use.  The wide angle, tilt-option uses 
                    a mechanical switch inside the float, while a hermetically sealed, axially nonposition-sensitive mercury switch is the narrow angle option.  
                    These floats provide a reliable, long-lasting level control suitable for most liquid environments up to 160 F.
